4. Column Descriptions:
Some of the notable columns in the dataset include:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
Date: Date of the order.
Sales Channel: Platform where the order was placed (e.g., Amazon.in).
Fulfillment: Fulfillment method (e.g., Merchant or Amazon).
Category: Product category (e.g., T-shirt, Blazer).
Amount: Total amount of the order.
ship-city, ship-state, ship-country: Shipping location details.
fulfilled-by: Indicates the fulfillment party (e.g., Easy Ship).

5. Exploration and Analysis:
The notebook is structured to further explore key metrics, such as:

Sales distribution across categories.
Fulfillment efficiency and sales channels.
Regional performance (based on shipping data).
